# Kafka Cart Abandonment Notifier ðŸš€

This project uses **Kafka (Sarama)** to track **cart events** and **order events** in an eCommerce system. If a user **adds an item to the cart but does not place an order within 30 minutes**, a **notification** is triggered.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- âœ… **Real-time tracking** of user actions (cart additions, orders).
- âœ… **Kafka-based event-driven architecture** for scalability.
- âœ… **Automated notifications** for abandoned carts.
- âœ… **In-memory or Redis-based tracking** for efficient monitoring.

## ðŸ”¹ Architecture
1. **Kafka Producers** â†’ Publish \`add_to_cart\` and \`order_placed\` events.
2. **Kafka Consumer (\`cart_watcher_service\`)** â†’ Monitors user cart activity.
3. **Abandoned Cart Checker** â†’ Runs every 30 minutes to detect inactive carts.
4. **Notification System** â†’ Sends email/SMS/push reminders to users.

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Go** (Sarama Kafka Client)
- **Apache Kafka** (Event Streaming)
- **Redis** (Optional, for session storage)
- **Docker** (For containerization)

## ðŸ”¹ Setup Instructions
1. **Start Kafka** using Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. **Run the Consumer Service**:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```
3. **Produce Sample Events** (using a Kafka producer or test script).

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
- A user **adds a product to the cart** â†’ Event stored in `cart_events` Kafka topic.
- A user **places an order** â†’ Event stored in `order_events` Kafka topic.
- If no order is placed within **30 minutes**, the system **sends a notification**.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Output
```
User user_123 added to cart: prod_001
User user_456 added to cart: prod_002
User user_123 placed an order: order_789
Sending reminder to user_456 for product prod_002
ðŸ”” Notification sent to user user_456: 'Complete your purchase for prod_002!'
```

## ðŸ”¹ Next Steps
âœ… **Use Redis instead of in-memory storage** for scalability.  
âœ… **Use Kafka's Streams API** for better real-time processing.  
âœ… **Integrate an actual notification system** like Twilio (SMS), Firebase (push notifications), or email services.

ðŸš€ Now your eCommerce backend can send real-time reminders for abandoned carts!
